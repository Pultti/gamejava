# gamejava

Spring Boot application that implements a simple quiz game. The game has a series of questions and keeps track of the user's score as well as the number of remaining attempts. The game can be interacted with via RESTful APIs, making it easy to integrate with various front-end technologies. It also includes features like game state management, which allows for the game to be reset and restarted.

Key Features:

    RESTful API endpoints for submitting answers and fetching questions.
    Game state management to handle ongoing, completed, or reset game states.
    Score tracking and remaining attempt tracking.
    Easily extendable question list and logic.

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand how to build a simple, but fully functional, game service with Spring Boot. It can also be extended to include features like multiplayer support, a front-end interface, or more complex scoring algorithms.
